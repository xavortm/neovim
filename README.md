# Neovim Configuration

My personal Neovim configuration.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Simple**: Aims to be close to vanilla nvim.
*   **Fast & Lightweight**: Optimized for performance.
*   **Smart Completion**: Powered by `luasnip` and `cmp`.
*   **LSP Support**: Full-featured language server support with `mason` and `lsp.lua`.
*   **Git Integration**: Seamless git integration with `gitsigns`.
*   **Fuzzy Finding**: Quick file and text searching with `telescope`.
*   **And much more...**

## üîå Plugins

This configuration is built on top of a curated list of plugins. Check out the `lua/alex/lazy` directory for the full list.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

The main keybindings are defined in `lua/alex/remap.lua`. `which-key.nvim` is used to display a popup with the available keybindings.
