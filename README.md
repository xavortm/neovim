## ‚ú® Features

*   **Simple, non-rizzed experience**: I tried to keep it close to vanilla nvim.

*   **Fuzzy Finding**: Quick file and text searching with `telescope`.
*   **And much more...**

This configuration is built on top of a curated list of plugins, including:

*   **[Blink.nvim](https://github.com/xavortm/blink.nvim)**: Easy navigation between files.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xavortm/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
2.  Start Neovim:
    ```bash
    nvim
    ```
    The plugins will be installed automatically by `lazy.nvim`.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

The main keybindings are defined in `lua/alex/remap.lua`. I use `which-key.nvim` to display a popup with the available keybindings. Here are some of the most important ones:

| Keybinding      | Description                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `<leader>e`     | Explore files                          |
| `<leader>p`     | Paste without losing the yanked text   |
| `J` / `K` (vis) | Move selected lines up/down            |
| `gD`            | Go to definition                       |
| `gd`            | Go to definition                       |
| `<leader>ca`    | Code action                            |
| `<leader>cr`    | Code references                        |
| `<leader>cn`    | Code rename                            |
| `<leader>sr`    | Search and replace word under cursor   |
| `<leader>cs`    | Search functions in workspace          |
| `<leader>df`    | Search functions in current document   |
| `<leader>ds`    | Search symbols in current document     |

### üìå Harpoon Usage

Harpoon allows you to quickly mark files and jump between them.

| Keybinding    | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<leader>a`   | Add the current file to the Harpoon list.              |
| `<C-e>`       | Toggle the Harpoon quick menu to see all marked files. |
| `<C-h>`       | Navigate to the 1st marked file.                       |
| `<C-j>`       | Navigate to the 2nd marked file.                       |
| `<C-k>`       | Navigate to the 3rd marked file.                       |
| `<C-l>`       | Navigate to the 4th marked file.                       |

### Intelephense License Setup

To use Intelephense with a license, you need to create a license file.

1.  Create a file `~/intelephense/licence.txt`.
2.  Add your license key to this file. Only add the license text inside, nothing else.

### WordPress Development

For WordPress development, you'll need to install `composer` and the `10up-default` coding standards for `phpcs`.

#### Composer Installation

First, install Composer globally. You can follow the official instructions on the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).

On macOS, you can use Homebrew:
